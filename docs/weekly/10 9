# Project Weekly Report
## Team Report
#### Section 1 (what did you do last week)
* Developed a drafting simulation program
* Developed database creation 
#### Section 2 (what did you do this week)
* Continue to make sure database is updated and connect to it
* Started to plan out how the prediction algorithm will work
#### Section 3 (next week)
* Continue to work on making sure database is working as needed
* We should start to develop other use cases (Trade Analyzer, Waiver Wire, Injury, Lineup)
## Individual Contributions
### Lily
#### Section 1 (what did you do last week)
* I tried to write some tests for our drafting program and connect it to a database.
#### Section 2 (what did you do this week)
* I did a bunch of research on the prediction algorithm and what kind of algorithm it will use (Markov decision process)
#### Section 3 (next week)
* Next week I want to start setting up the prediction algorithm for the games.
### Akhil
#### Section 1 (what did you do last week)
* Scrape data from web using Basketball Reference website
* Created the database using sqlite which has over 500 players 
#### Section 2 (what did you do this week)
* Continue to improve the layot of database making sure all data is accurate
* Connected database to draft simulation code and test it
#### Section 3 (next week)
* Continue to enhance data quality and consistency
* Connect the database to other use case when we create codes for them
### Mahir
#### Section 1 (what did you do last week) 
* Assisted Akhil on making fantasy nba mock draft that was linked to a database with over 500 players
#### Section 2 (what did you do this week) 
* Added more features on the mock draft, that tells user who to draft based on suggestions and gave players a score that helped user get an idea of what the best players are  
#### Section 3 (Next week)
* Continue adding more features on the mock draft
### Yohanse
#### Section 1 (Last week)

#### Section 2(what did you do this week)
* Talked to the team on what our progress looks like so far
#### Section 3 (Next week)
* Talk to the team on how what our progress looks like so far
* Planning to discuss what tools to add in building our fantasy assistance while building the prediction algorithm.
* Find ways to be more efficient in progressing the project
### Syed 
### Section 1 (Last week)
* did research on what languages to use to work on the backend part of project.
### Section 2(what did you do this week)
* Continued to research and finalize the language and framework to use for the backend.
#### Section 3 (Next week)
* Collaborate with Akhil to integrate the backend with the database and ensure smooth data flow.
* Begin implementing the backend logic and services.
