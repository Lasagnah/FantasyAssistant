Work more on use cases
Individual Contributions
Lily
Section 1 (what did you do last week)
Next week I want to start setting up the prediction algorithm for the games.
Section 2 (what did you do this week)
This week I did a bunch of research on Qlearning and Sarsa stuff to work on the prediction algorithm.
Section 3 (next week)
Next week I want to create the implementation for the prediction algorithm using Markov decision processes
Akhil
Section 1 (what did you do last week)
Continue to improve the layot of database making sure all data is accurate
Succesfully connected database to draft code
We now have a working draft simulation with all the players added in a database
Section 2 (what did you do this week)
Work on updating database to use stats from this year and last as they are more relavent
Section 3 (next week)
Continue to enhance data quality and consistency
Connect the database to other use case when we create codes for them
Mahir
Section 1 (what did you do last week)
Added scores to the players based on the stats so it suggests who the best player to draft best on the available players during the draft
Section 2 (what did you do this week)
Downloaded ESPN fantasy app to see what kind of feature we will need to put to take it to the next level
Section 3 (Next week)
Continue to monitor the fantasy apps across all platforms to see which key features we might need to implement
Yohanse
Section 1 (Last week)
Checked the project progress with Akhil and offered help if any is needed
Downloaded ESPN Fantasy to mess around and check how NBA Fantasy managers manage their team
Watched some videos of what the important stats are
Section 2(what did you do this week)
Checked progress
Section 3 (Next week)
Work on testing and continuous integration assignments with the team
Syed
Section 1 (Last week)
Started planning the structure of the backend services and how they will interact with the database.
Section 2(what did you do this week)
Progressed with initial backend setup, implementing foundational services and setting up core database connections. Defined key API endpoints for essential use cases, ensuring alignment with overall project requirements.
Section 3 (Next week)
Begin setting up backend infrastructure for testing and debugging to streamline future development.
Collaborate with the team to integrate backend components with frontend, focusing on enhancing user experience and ensuring seamless data flow between layers.
