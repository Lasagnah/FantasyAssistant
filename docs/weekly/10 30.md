# Project Weekly Report
## Team Report
#### Section 1 (what did you do last week)
* Continue to work on making sure database is working as needed
* We should start to develop other use cases (Trade Analyzer, Waiver Wire, Injury, Lineup)
#### Section 2 (what did you do this week)
* Work more on prediction algorithm (Implement Qlearning, Sarsa, etc)
#### Section 3 (next week)
* Put together a prototype of prediction algorithm
* Work more on use cases
## Individual Contributions
### Lily
#### Section 1 (what did you do last week)
* Next week I want to start setting up the prediction algorithm for the games.
#### Section 2 (what did you do this week)
* This week I did a bunch of research on Qlearning and Sarsa stuff to work on the prediction algorithm. 
#### Section 3 (next week)
* Next week I want to create the implementation for the prediction algorithm using Markov decision processes
### Akhil
#### Section 1 (what did you do last week)
* Continue to improve the layot of database making sure all data is accurate
* Succesfully connected database to draft code
* We now have a working draft simulation with all the players added in a database
#### Section 2 (what did you do this week)
* Work on updating database to use stats from this year and last as they are more relavent
#### Section 3 (next week)
* Continue to enhance data quality and consistency
* Connect the database to other use case when we create codes for them
### Mahir
#### Section 1 (what did you do last week) 
* Added scores to the players based on the stats so it suggests who the best player to draft best on the available players during the draft  
#### Section 2 (what did you do this week) 
*Downloaded ESPN fantasy app to see what kind of feature we will need to put to take it to the next level 
#### Section 3 (Next week)
* Continue to monitor the fantasy apps across all platforms to see which key features we might need to implement 
### Yohanse
#### Section 1 (Last week)
* Talked to the team on what our progress looks like so far
#### Section 2(what did you do this week)
* Checked the project progress with Akhil and offered help if any is needed
* Downloaded ESPN Fantasy to mess around and check how NBA Fantasy managers manage their team
* Watched some videos of what the important stats are
#### Section 3 (Next week)
* Find ways to be more efficient in progressing the project
* Work on testing and continuous integration assignment with the team
### Syed 
### Section 1 (Last week)
* Researched and evaluated different programming languages and frameworks to determine the best option for the backend of the project.
### Section 2(what did you do this week)
Started planning the structure of the backend services and how they will interact with the database.
#### Section 3 (Next week)
* Begin setting up the necessary infrastructure for backend testing and debugging.
* Collaborate with the team on integrating the backend with front-end components to ensure smooth user interactions.
